# Survey form with React

This week we practised React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I started out with an idea of what the survey would be about, and then started with components, and planning how it was gonna look/ funktion. If I had more time, i would like to make if/else statements inside the map. based on previus questions. I tried out and have some idea of how, but didnt manage and decided to make the survey less complex (for me as im still new to code). I'd also add some sort of alert message that answers are required. Id also add a progress bar.
